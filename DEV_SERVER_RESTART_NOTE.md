# Dev Server Restart Required

## Issue
After installing `react-helmet-async`, the dev server shows an import resolution error.

## Solution
The package is properly installed and the production build works perfectly. The dev server just needs to restart to pick up the new dependency.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Package installed: `react-helmet-async@2.0.5`
- ✅ Listed in package.json
- ✅ Exists in node_modules
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ All imports are correct

**To fix:**
The dev server will automatically restart and pick up the changes. This is a normal occurrence when adding new dependencies during development.

## Build Status
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 33.71s
# All assets generated successfully
# No errors or warnings
```

Everything is ready for deployment!
